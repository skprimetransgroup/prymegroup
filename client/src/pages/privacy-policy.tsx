              <p>
                Pryme Group maintains that it will identify the purpose(s) for collecting personal information and inform the affected individuals of the intended purpose. When the intended use for the collected information involves releasing it to an interested third party, Pryme Group will ensure the individual grants consent before any information is released. Consent for these purposes can be either explicit or implicit depending on the sensitivity of the information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pryme Group will only collect information for which there is an intended purpose. The collected information will only be used for the purposes stated. Should the information be necessary for purposes other than those stated, separate consent will be obtained. This is true for all situations except those where Pryme Group has obtained general consent or where the particular use is required by law or required by the police for an investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                All third-party suppliers, vendors and clients to which personal information may be released will have been carefully screened to ensure their Privacy Policies meet or exceed the legislated requirements.
